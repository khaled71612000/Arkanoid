# Arkanoid Unreal Using C++

**Arkanoid Unreal Using C++** is a project that recreates the classic Arkanoid game using Unreal Engine and C++. This project showcases advanced game development techniques, including physics interactions, game state management, and rendering in Unreal Engine.

## Key Components

### BallMovementComponent.cpp
- **Ball Dynamics:** Implements the physics and movement logic for the ball, including collision detection and response.
- **Velocity Control:** Manages the ball's velocity to ensure smooth and realistic movement.

### PaddleController.cpp
- **Player Input:** Handles player input to control the paddle's movement.
- **Collision Handling:** Manages interactions between the paddle and the ball.

### BrickManager.cpp
- **Brick Layout:** Generates and manages the layout of bricks in the game.
- **Collision Detection:** Detects and handles collisions between the ball and the bricks.

### GameManager.cpp
- **Game State Management:** Oversees the overall game state, including starting, pausing, and resetting the game.
- **Scoring System:** Tracks and updates the player's score based on brick collisions.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay:** Recreates the traditional Arkanoid gameplay with modern enhancements.
- **Advanced Physics:** Utilizes Unreal Engine's physics engine for realistic ball and paddle interactions.
- **Responsive Controls:** Ensures smooth and responsive paddle control for an optimal player experience.
- **Dynamic Level Management:** Generates dynamic levels and manages brick layouts efficiently.

This project serves as a comprehensive example for game developers looking to create engaging and dynamic games using Unreal Engine and C++.
